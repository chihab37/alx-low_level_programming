0x0B. C - malloc, free

0-create_array.c : Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

1-strdup.c : a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, 
	which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

	The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. 
	Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free
	Returns NULL if str = NULL
	On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available

2-str_concat.c : a function that concatenates two strings.

	The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, 
	followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated
	if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
	The function should return NULL on failure

3-alloc_grid.c : a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

	Each element of the grid should be initialized to 0
	The function should return NULL on failure
	If width or height is 0 or negative, return NULL

4-free_grid.c : a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

100-argstostr.c : a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

	Returns NULL if ac == 0 or av == NULL
	Returns a pointer to a new string, or NULL if it fails

101-strtow.c :  a function that splits a string into words.

	The function returns a pointer to an array of strings (words)
	Each element of this array should contain a single word, null-terminated
	The last element of the returned array should be NULL
	Words are separated by spaces
	Returns NULL if str == NULL or str == ""
	If your function fails, it should return NULL
