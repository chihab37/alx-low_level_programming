0x03. C - Debugging

0-main.c : a file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0

1-main.c : Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

    Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.

2-largest_number.c : This program prints the largest of three integers.

	Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
	Line count will not be checked for this task.
    
3-print_remaining_days.c : program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year,
				taking leap year into consideration.
